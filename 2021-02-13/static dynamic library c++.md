### static dynamic library c++





 

```
I was trying to run osrm-example binary compiled in my pc(linux mint), on other docker file(debian). I learned that osrm is static library meaning that it is included in the binary itself. Yet other libraries like boost are were linked dynamically, meaning it must be present on environment, not included in binary.
