```
Configuration for applets (also for desklets and extensions; the common expression is spice) get stored in the folder ~/.cinnamon/configs/the_name_of_the_spice). ~ is a shortcut for your home. Note that .cinnamon is a hidden folder, you need to make hidden files visible to see them in your file manager (ctrl-h).
