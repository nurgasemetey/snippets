```
After buying 3 pairs of headphones in Beijing xiaomi shop on one pairs of Airdrops problem with only one headphone connection appears. I go to xiaomi store for help to solve this problem but only thing they wanna do, was clicking everything on headphones and told me that it's out of stock and they can give me refund becouse it's manufacture problem and they can't solve it. Of course I don't agree and with one pair working and one not working I spend few hours to find how it's work and a way to resolve the problem.

Procedure : STEP_1. Put your Airdrops in the box, make sure that its charged. Delete airdots from your device.

STEP_2. Take out both of your Airdrops from box

STEP_3. Turn off both of Airdrops by pressing and keeping button on it for 5 seconds (until you see red light)

STEP_4. Perform 2 kind of reset (reset of stored Bluetooth device and reset of connection between both Airdrops headphones) To make this reset, press and hold button on both airdrops for 20seconds (headphone have to blink after 10seconds and 20seconds) don't release the buttons until you don't see second blinking.

STEP_5. Turn on your Airdrops by pressing and holding button on both of it for 5seconds or put it in box and take it out. (when you take it out from box they will automatically turn on).

After done restart, on right headphone you have to see blinking white light but on left one you have to see no light. It's mean that there is connection between headphone, and right headphone is waiting for connection with phone.

STEP_6. Enjoy :>

Edit_1 Im sure about point 4 bevouse it's in original instruction. First reset (first 10 seconds of holding, removes saves devices in AirDots) Second reset (next 10 seconds of holding (totally 20sec) restart connection between pair of AirDots).

Probably it will be enought to perform this reset only on left one headphone becouse I think that left one have problem with connection but it's only supposition. So u have to perform the same reset of both headphones to make sure that it will work.
