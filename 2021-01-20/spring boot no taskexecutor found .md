### spring boot no taskexecutor found

Here is the answer https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14271
As Juergen Hoeller noticed - this is INFO-level message, not an ERROR, even not a WARNING.

But he also said "I'd strongly recommend an explicit executor setup indeed". Let's configure executor for async tasks then.

---
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class SpringAsyncConfig {

    @Bean
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        return new SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor(); // Or use another one of your liking
    }
}
```
