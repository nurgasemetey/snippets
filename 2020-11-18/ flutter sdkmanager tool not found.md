###  flutter sdkmanager tool not found


[Android sdkmanager tool not found (C:...\Local\Android\sdk\tools\bin\sdkmanager) 路 Issue #20976 路 flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/20976 "Android sdkmanager tool not found (C:...\Local\Android\sdk\tools\bin\sdkmanager) 路 Issue #20976 路 flutter/flutter")


 

```
This worked for me:

open Android Studio's SDK Manager
go to the Android SDK tab
under SDK Tools, uncheck Hide Obsolete Packages
install Android SDK Tools (Obsolete)
```
