###  linux mint xreader auto scroll disable


[Feature request: option to disable auto scroll 路 Issue #27 路 linuxmint/xreader](https://github.com/linuxmint/xreader/issues/27 "Feature request: option to disable auto scroll 路 Issue #27 路 linuxmint/xreader")


 

```
I am not sure, it is XReader feature or maybe Cinnamon: when I move mouse to top or down of screen auto scrolling starts. It is very annoying for me. Can you add a disable option for it?
UPD: reopening document disable auto scroll.


```
